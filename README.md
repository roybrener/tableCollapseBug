# tableCollapseBug
I've created a simple table with 2 rows. The 2nd row is hidden using `class="collapse"`. After clicking the first row
The second row is being showed but then losses It's width- 2 row doesn't cover all the colSpan

When removing the "class=collapse" then the row cover the full colSpan
